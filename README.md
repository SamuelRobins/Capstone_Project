Getting Data from contributor for selected modeling

This project is designed for the automobile industry. It is for those who sell used cars. I have acquired data on used cars. I have also built a model that learns from that data by analyzing the features of those cars. The model I created can predict how much a used car will see for based on the features of that car such as the company, te engine time, the amount of miles on the car, ect... This will help car dealers know how much a prospective car will sell for once the acquire it. The market for used cars is very subjective so it is likley the will find a car that they can acquire for less than the model predicts they can purchase it for, and then they can sell the car for the predicted price. I am confident in this perspective because our model has demonstrated a strong understanding of the data with the testing that I have done.

The data I used for this analysis is from Kaggle.com. It contains 973 entries of used cars. It tells there features and how much they sold for. There sales price was my target feature.
