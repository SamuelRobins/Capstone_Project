    "This project is made for Echo Park Automotive. They are a used car dealership. I have made a Decision Tree Regressor model. This model will process the data of used cars, their features, and their price. Aftrer learning the relationships between the details or features of the car and its selling price, it can begin to analize a car and predict its price. This has been created so that Echo Park Automotive can decide which cars to buy. If the model predicts a higher selling price than what is proposed on a prospective car, they should buy it and can flip the car. If the model predicts a lower selling price then what is proposed, then they should not buy the car."

From my intuition I believe that 5 will be the best amount of minimum samples to split. Thats essentialy how deap the tree goes. But I could be either to high or too low with that estimation.

    "We recommend that Echo Park Automotive used our model to predict the price of used cars. We recommend that they buy used cars which are selling for less than their predicted price. After buying the cars, they can then flip them for the predicted price. They will make money because they have sold cars for more than they have bought them. We also recommend that Echo Park Automotive does not buy cars which are selling for more than their predicted price."

    "We essentially used a series of web scraped data to make a model that is capable of monetizing accuracy on a market analysis. Not every car sells for the exact price it should based on its featues. This is due to many variables which are yet to be identified. What we have done is created a way for Echo Park Automotive to accuratley predict the selling price of a used car and to capitalize on the wide range of the selling market. We have created a model that has an R_squared score of 92. That is highly accurate and gives Echo Park Automotive the confidence they need to invest based off of our model. We can see that there were many steps taken into buildign the model including data analysis, data prep, figuring out which kind of model best suits our data, piping some of our data prep into our model tuning and engaging in a grid search to create our most accurate model. What has resulted of this is guide for the business model of Echo Park Automotive.  "

    "First let's acknowledge that the model is a little bit over fit to the data. This is something we would work on down the road. The main goal moving forward is to apply this concept to many other kinds of assets. There is so much more data out there that we can tap into. The last thing is that we would set a stream of data that is constantly webscraping to update our model. Market's change and shift. In todays world, you need to be constantly ready to evolve or you will get overpowered by a competitor."
